<small>[real shoddy picture]</small></p>
<p>This is how I discovered them 4 hours before their only local show for a while as they head off on a European Tour.</p>
<p>I met Jon Pierce (of the newly formed The Drums) a couple summers ago at a lazy weekend afternoon party at his then apartment. I saw a lot of press recently around his new work (I love hearing that folks I&#8217;ve met are doing well, and hearing about the new stuff they&#8217;re working on. Watching growth is pretty amazing.), and this afternoon I finally sat down to listen to <a href="myspace.com/thedrumsforever" target="_blank"><strong>The Drums</strong></a>, which turned me onto the <a href="rcrdlbl.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Rcrd Lbl</strong></a> site where I spent some nice time discovering new artists. </p>
<p>I happened to check out <a href="myspace.com/localnatives" target="_blank"><strong>Local Natives&#8217; myspace</strong></a> and saw they were playing a few miles from where I&#8217;m currently staying. $10 door for an all ages show.. that, or it being LA might explain the toxic smell of Fructis corn syrup shampoo in female hair.</p>
<p>They put on a nice show.. I mean, I was only 4-hours familiar with their music, but what I heard online got me to the door of the venue and a 40 minute line. The pace reminded a little of Brooklyn-based Grizzly Bear or as one friend pointed out: XTC, but these guys are from the west coast (silverlake!). I found the consistent harmonizing endearing, and favored their more dramatic melodies.</p>
<p>The one thing I paid good notice to was that bassist Andy Hamm had the best style of anyone in the venue.. oversized deconstructed grey knit cardigan, and I believe drop crotch pants, something like tan boat shoes, and a baseball cap. Seeing personal style independent of the local culture is always a treat.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I got to check out The Echo on my first night out in LA. I know of nowhere to go, so everything is new to me.</p>
<p>(As for their openers.. while Voxhaul Broadcast&#8217;s new songs aren&#8217;t *bad*, the older ones made me cringe for their flatness. The attempt at tormented screaming at the end of the set left an unerasable expression of horror on my face. I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking that their reference was <a href="myspace.com/theveils" target="_blank"><strong>THE VEILS THE VEILS THE VEILS</strong></a>. Oh The Veils, I appreciate you so much more now.)</p>
